# Orderly will store data in a sqlite database, by default orderly.sqlite
*.sqlite

# It is suggested to use environment variables, in either
# orderly_envir.yml or .Renviron to store sensitive data to use with
# orderly - keep those out of git
.Renviron
orderly_envir.yml

# Other good things to exclude
.Rhistory
.Rdata
.Rproj.user
